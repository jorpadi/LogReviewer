# Engine Log Analyzer

A modular log analysis tool designed to parse, analyze, and detect anomalies
in Engine / Laser / Workflow systems using pluggable checkers.

## Key Features
- Structured log parsing
- Plugin-based checker architecture
- Stateful and stateless checkers
- Time-based anomaly detection (uptime gaps)
- Extensible domain separation (engine, laser, common)
- Output files such as: text, csv, png and report in word or pdf. (upcoming)
- Check complete flow for event (upcoming - cross log revisor)
- Check phase times (upcoming - engine only) 


## Project Status
Early development – architecture and foundations in progress.
