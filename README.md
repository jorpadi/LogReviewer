# Engine Log Analyzer

A modular log analysis tool designed to parse, analyze, and detect anomalies
in Engine / Laser / Workflow systems using pluggable checkers.

## Key Features
- Structured log parsing
- Plugin-based checker architecture
- Stateful and stateless checkers
- Time-based anomaly detection (uptime gaps)
- Extensible domain separation (engine, laser, common)

## Project Status
Early development – architecture and foundations in progress.
